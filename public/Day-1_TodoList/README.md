# ✅ Task 4 :- To-do – Web Game 

Welcome to the Smart To-Do web application repository! This is a dynamic, browser-based task manager built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to improve productivity and time management. The app features task scheduling, reminders, real-time countdowns, and a polished UI—built entirely on the frontend, without any backend or external database.

## 🎓 This project was developed as part of the Skill Craft Internship program to demonstrate practical frontend development skills.

## 🗂️ About the Project
 To-Do Web App is a handy little task manager built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps you keep track of your tasks easily—add, edit, complete, or delete them whenever you want. You’ll get reminders with sound and notifications, plus a cool countdown to your next task. It also has a light/dark mode and automatically sorts your tasks by their due time. This project was created during the Skill Craft Internship to boost productivity with a simple, clean design—all running right in your browser.
